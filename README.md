## Dataset

Dataset is available at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OYc1ZZzOeyFWTkMWj3lwfqgMy72B9YVx/view?usp=sharing).

After unzipping the file, you will find two files:

- `label2ind.json`: a json file that maps the author name to an index.
- `train.txt`: a text file that contains the training data. (Approx. 1.2GB)

Please put these two files in the `data` folder.
